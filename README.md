# Feature Visualization & Style Transfer

## Feature Visualization

Creating images that maximize the activation of a specific filter, neuron, layer, or any other computational unit. Some straightforward examples can be found in [feature_visu.ipynb](feature_visu.ipynb). This is an old repo and my implementation of feature wisualization here did work out so well. See https://github.com/deel-ai/xplique for a good implementation.

## Style Transfer

Transfer statistics of the image while preserving local patterns, resulting in an image with the style of another but the composition of the original. Some examples can be found in [demonic_blender.ipynb](demonic_blender.ipynb). These examples only demonstrate a basic method. More advanced methods use Optimal Transport for better and faster results. *TODO: Include Optimal Transport examples.*
